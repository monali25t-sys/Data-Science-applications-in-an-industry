# Data-Science-applications-in-an-industry
The role of Data Science Applications hasn't evolved overnight. Thanks to faster computing and cheaper storage, we can now predict outcomes in minutes, what could take several human hours to process.

A Data Scientist gets home a whopping $124,000 a year and they owe it to the deficiency of skilled professionals in this field. This is the reason why Data Science Certifications are at an all-time high!

Through this blog, we bring to you, 10 applications that build upon the concepts of Data Science, exploring various domains such as the following:
- Fraud and Risk Detection
- Healthcare
- Internet Search
- Targeted Advertising
- Website Recommendations
- Advanced Image Recognition
- Speech Recognition
- Airline Route Planning
- Gaming
- Augmented Reality
# Fraud and Risk Detection
The earliest applications of data science were in Finance. Companies were fed up of bad debts and losses every year. However, they had a lot of data which use to get collected during the initial paperwork while sanctioning loans. They decided to bring in data scientists in order to rescue them out of losses.

Over the years, banking companies learned to divide and conquer data via customer profiling, past expenditures, and other essential variables to analyze the probabilities of risk and default. Moreover, it also helped them to push their banking products based on customer's purchasing power.
# Healthcare
The healthcare sector, especially, receives great benefits from data science applications.
## 1. Medical Image Analysis
Procedures such as detecting tumors, artery stenosis, organ delineation employ various different methods and frameworks like MapReduce to find optimal parameters for tasks like lung texture classification. It applies machine learning methods, support vector machines (SVM), content-based medical image indexing, and wavelet analysis for solid texture classification.

## 2. Genetics & Genomics
Data Science applications also enable an advanced level of treatment personalization through research in genetics and genomics. The goal is to understand the impact of the DNA on our health and find individual biological connections between genetics, diseases, and drug response. Data science techniques allow integration of different kinds of data with genomic data in the disease research, which provides a deeper understanding of genetic issues in reactions to particular drugs and diseases. As soon as we acquire reliable personal genome data, we will achieve a deeper understanding of the human DNA. The advanced genetic risk prediction will be a major step towards more individual care.
## 3. Drug Development
The drug discovery process is highly complicated and involves many disciplines. The greatest ideas are often bounded by billions of testing, huge financial and time expenditure. On average, it takes twelve years to make an official submission.

Data science applications and machine learning algorithms simplify and shorten this process, adding a perspective to each step from the initial screening of drug compounds to the prediction of the success rate based on the biological factors. Such algorithms can forecast how the compound will act in the body using advanced mathematical modeling and simulations instead of the “lab experiments”. The idea behind the computational drug discovery is to create computer model simulations as a biologically relevant network simplifying the prediction of future outcomes with high accuracy.
## 4. Virtual assistance for patients and customer support
Optimization of the clinical process builds upon the concept that for many cases it is not actually necessary for patients to visit doctors in person. A mobile application can give a more effective solution by bringing the doctor to the patient instead.

The AI-powered mobile apps can provide basic healthcare support, usually as chatbots. You simply describe your symptoms, or ask questions, and then receive key information about your medical condition derived from a wide network linking symptoms to causes. Apps can remind you to take your medicine on time, and if necessary, assign an appointment with a doctor.

This approach promotes a healthy lifestyle by encouraging patients to make healthy decisions, saves their time waiting in line for an appointment, and allows doctors to focus on more critical cases.

# Internet Search
Now, this is probably the first thing that strikes your mind when you think Data Science Applications.

When we speak of search, we think ‘Google’. Right? But there are many other search engines like Yahoo, Bing, Ask, AOL, and so on. All these search engines (including Google) make use of data science algorithms to deliver the best result for our searched query in a fraction of seconds. Considering the fact that, Google processes more than 20 petabytes of data every day.

Had there been no data science, Google wouldn’t have been the ‘Google’ we know today.
