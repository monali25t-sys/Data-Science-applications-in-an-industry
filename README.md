# Data-Science-applications-in-an-industry
The role of Data Science Applications hasn't evolved overnight. Thanks to faster computing and cheaper storage, we can now predict outcomes in minutes, what could take several human hours to process.

A Data Scientist gets home a whopping $124,000 a year and they owe it to the deficiency of skilled professionals in this field. This is the reason why Data Science Certifications are at an all-time high!

Through this blog, we bring to you, 10 applications that build upon the concepts of Data Science, exploring various domains such as the following:
- Fraud and Risk Detection
- Healthcare
- Internet Search
- Targeted Advertising
- Website Recommendations
- Advanced Image Recognition
- Speech Recognition
- Airline Route Planning
- Gaming
- Augmented Reality
# Fraud and Risk Detection
The earliest applications of data science were in Finance. Companies were fed up of bad debts and losses every year. However, they had a lot of data which use to get collected during the initial paperwork while sanctioning loans. They decided to bring in data scientists in order to rescue them out of losses.

Over the years, banking companies learned to divide and conquer data via customer profiling, past expenditures, and other essential variables to analyze the probabilities of risk and default. Moreover, it also helped them to push their banking products based on customer's purchasing power.
# Healthcare
The healthcare sector, especially, receives great benefits from data science applications.
## 1. Medical Image Analysis
Procedures such as detecting tumors, artery stenosis, organ delineation employ various different methods and frameworks like MapReduce to find optimal parameters for tasks like lung texture classification. It applies machine learning methods, support vector machines (SVM), content-based medical image indexing, and wavelet analysis for solid texture classification.
